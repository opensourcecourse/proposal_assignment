# Science Repo Proposal


Science:
(Briefly describe the science behind your repo (feel free to copy an abstract here))

Outputs:
(Clearly define the outputs of your repo (usually figures))

Structure:
(Describe how you will structure your project? Please outline the specific
files and directories. Here is an example structure we discussed in class:

```code
Simple Project 
├── a010_download_data.py
├── a020_preprocess_seismograms.py
├── a030_detect_earthquakes.py            
├── a040_plot_detections.py
├── local.py
├── utils.py  
├── inputs/
├── outputs/
├──── a010_raw_data
├──── a020_preprocessed_seismograms
├──── ...
├── environment.yml  
├── README.md   
└── test_*.py...
```
)

Testing:
(How will you test your repo? Do you need a separate test files or are your tests contained 
in the code?)

Reproducibility:
(How do you plan to make your environment reproducible, e.g., conda, docker, pip freeze, etc.)

Distribution:
(How to do you plan to make your code easy for others to find and run? Where will it be hosted?)
